<!--
	2015/03/13	dkaragon@marine		initial: built script off our old SBDTBD MA script to be much faster and more efficient
									goal was to shorten surface time.  This coupled with some GPS/SBD changes to limit surface time
									also added archve option on dockzr
									There are some aggressive settings in here, notably if file transfer fails the first time it may not try again
									
	2015/06/26	dkaragon@marine		eliminated the callback 5 option for a glider in gliderdos.  Would rather a glider run mission than drift.
	
	2015/07/06	dkaragon@marine		!k was still being sent as a test for if at prompt, this had an unintended effect of keeping the surface 	drift tickle alive; added a GPS Location state for wait for transfer, if it hangs up and calls back in it just dives
	2015/07/15	dkaragon@marine		disabled a verify zma state that caused ru28 to go back to dockzr state premature
									changed wait for transfer, waitForTransfer, to GLD:success, it was catching SCI:success which is premature
	2015/08/15	dkaragon@marine		ru29 had a surfacing where dockzr went through to glider but the 'not found' trigger in wait for zrma didn't trigger.  I added a short timeout to that state since other actions were noted not to work.  2 min timeout should reset the glider before it dives, not ideal.  Also shortened most of the 10 min timers to 5 for this reason.
	
	2015/09/15	dkaragon@marine		ru28 surfacing had double control f, it gave one after done, but it didn't go through until next round of dialog came by, causing it to send another from the Control-R trigger in waitforreloadma.  I stopped the control F after done, so that wait for reload is stuck in a loop and will issue control F until it registers it
									modified sendzmodem to have trigger if it detects files are being sent.  this is a result of a strange occurrence that a s tbd sbd went through but was not seen immediately, it caused a surface dialog to go before command, this caused the state to go back to sendzmodem while the glider was transferring.  Added check to sendzmodem if we are transferring to move to wait for transfer
	2016/7/20	dkaragon@marine		no more fast development, calling it fast script now	
	2019/10/21	dkaragon@marine		added section after MA transfer to do a sci file transfer.  It moves cfg dat ini files currently.  If it sees a xxx verify fail it moves onward.  if script works, TBD transfer is important, might want it to not go onward and retry.
									Also it triggers on sensor: which is pretty broad (not ideal), BUT most surfacings do not have an MA file.  I don't want this to add time to surfacings so triggering on sensor allows it to take place at same time as dockzr *.ma.  If it triggers on GPS it may not register in time for the control R sendzmodem looks for
	2020/08/6	dkaragon@marine		sci file transfer wait for was triggering on Done! which didn't happen, seems succeeded:szr is the one at least on ru34
									added a science error section for verify zmodem.  cycles science and moves on, no idea if it works
