# 05-Sep-01 tc@DinkumSoftware.com Added c_wpt_lat/lon m_gps_lat/lon
# 14-Jul-03  fnj@DinkumSoftware.com  Added optional record interval (secs)
#                                    If 0 or not present, do it the old way

#
# All the arguments related to a given sensor needs to be placed
# on a single line.  The name of the sensor is required, whitespace
# delimited optional arguments may follow: (The [] means argument is
# optional)
#                                                   
# <sensor_name> [<interval>] [<state>] [<halfyos>] [<yo_duty_cycle>]
# 
#   <sensor_name> specifies that the sensor be stored in the *.sbd file
# 
#                  Default    sensor value is only stored when....
# 
#     <interval>       0      There have been this many secs since
#                             the last value was stored.  0 means
#                             store every value.
# 
#     <state>         15      A code representing what the glider
#                             is doing: dive(1)/hover(2)/climb(4)/surface(8)
#                             Data only stored when glider is doing
#                             what is specified. 15 is always store.
#                             See ‘doco/how-to-operate/controlling-contents-of-Xbd-file.txt’ for more info.
# 
#     <halfyos>       -1      For this many dive/climbs in this
#                             segment, e.g. since last surfacing.
#                             -1 means stored for all dive/climbs
#                             See ‘doco/how-to-operate/controlling-contents-of-Xbd-file.txt’ for more info.
# 
#    <yo_duty_cycle>  -1      Only stores data every n"th" yo in this 
#                             segment, i.e. would cause data from 
#                             every 10th dive&climb to be stored.
#                             <= 1 means every dive&climb.
# 
# Because the options are positional, if you want to specify
# <halfyos> you must specify <state> and <interval>, etc.
# 
# Any omitted arguments take on default values.
